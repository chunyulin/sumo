## Usage:
0) use ./fixIndirectTurn.py to setup contPos automatically.
1) Define the amount of traffic flow in od.txt and tc.py.
2) Add detectos on netedit, or use ./add_detectors.bat to add detectors around all junction. (Only need to do once.)
3) Run simulation "python ./tc.py --dt 0.5 --end 3600 -p real"
